# The Overture Tool Documentation

This repository holds the canonical version of the VDM Language Manual, among other documents.  The issues tracker associated with the repository is intended to track general issues with the documentation. Requests for modifications to the language should be done at https://github.com/overturetool/language.

Any editing of these documents should be carried out in the `editing` branch. Changes to this branch
are pulled into `master` as part of the release process.
