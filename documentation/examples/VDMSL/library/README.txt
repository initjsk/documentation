This specification is for a bibliography database. It has been written
by Anne Maarsel when she was a student working at OECD Halden Reator
Project in the Summer of 1998. Note that this specification can be
improved in various ways. First of all it introduces post-conditions
that are not really adding much value since they are virtually
identical to the explicit bodies. In addition the use of an optional
type instead of <nil> would be appropriate here.
