The purpose of the hub in safe mode is to allow a service technician
to physically enter the hub of the wind turbine to carry out
maintenance. For the service technician to do so without risking his
life, it must be guaranteed that the main shaft connected to the rotor
of the wind turbine, is at a complete stand still and securely
locked. This model is made by Klaus Petersen as a small mini-project in a
course on "Modelling of Mission Critical Systems" (see
https://services.brics.dk/java/courseadmin/TOMoMi/pages/Modelling+of+Mission+Critical+Systems). 

More information about the model and the purpose of it can be found in
the Report.pdf file included in the zip file with the source files.
