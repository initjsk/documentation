Master Thesis from the Engineering College of Aarhus, Denmark - Cand. Polyt. (Jasper Moltke Nygaard, Rasmus Ask SÃ¸rensen), "Evaluating Distributed Architectures using VDM++ Real-Time Modeling with a Proof of Concept Implementation", 7th. December 2007.

This thesis will investigate and analyze the possibility of obtaining early stage validation of potential candidate system architectures, by means of formal modelling and validation. The goal is to analyze recent research extensions of VDM++ for describing and analyzing such distributed systems (VICE) and see if the language is suitable to stress test a distributed system and validate any architectural benets. Additionally this thesis will discus favorable approaches for realizing a case study of a transportation system in Tokyo, referred to as CyberRail. Different VDM++ models of candidate architectures for the CyberRail system has been developed and validated. This thesis includes 2 Real-Time VDM++ models (Backend Responsibility source, Joint Responsibility source), based on 2 different architectures. One of the architectures is realized as a prototype implementation in Java (source). Additionally a first draft of a distributed logging framework JAVTU (source), resembling the VDMTools interpreter execution trace log has been developed and a deployment manipulation tool Repeater (source) for setting up the deployment and the enviroment in VDMTools.
