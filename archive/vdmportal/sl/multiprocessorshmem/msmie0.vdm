\section{Third specification}

This is the most abstract specification.

\begin{vdm_al}

state #S0 of

 b : bool
 ms : set of MName

inv mk_#S0(b, ms) == 
       b = false => ms = {}

init s == s = mk_#S0(false, {})
end

\end{vdm_al}

The operations are specified as follows:

\begin{vdm_al}

operations

slave ()
ext wr b : bool

pre true

post b = true; 

acq (l:MName)

ext rd b : bool
    wr ms : (set of MName)

pre b = true and not (l in set ms)

post ms = ms~ union {l} ;

rel (l:MName)

ext wr ms : (set of MName)

pre l in set ms

post ms = ms~ \ {l}

\end{vdm_al}
