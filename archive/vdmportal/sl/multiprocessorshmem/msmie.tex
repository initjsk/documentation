\section{Introduction}

The Multiprocessor Shared-Memory Information Exchange (MSMIE) is a
protocol for ``inter-processor communications in distributed,
microprocessor-based nuclear safety systems'' which has been used in
the embedded software of Westinghouse nucear systems designs.
This small note contains three level of abstract descriptions
expressed using VDM-SL (and one alternative modelling strategy). 

More information about the protocol can be found in ``Multiprocessor
Shared-Memory Information Exchange'' by L.L.\ Santoline et al. This
was published in IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 16(1),
1989. More information about the VDM model (and a corresponding PVS
model) and the analysis of it can be found in ``Proof in VDM: Case
Studies'' edited by J.C.\ Bicarregui. This is published by Springer in
the FACIT series with ISBN 3540761861.
