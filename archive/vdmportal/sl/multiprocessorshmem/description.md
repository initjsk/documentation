Multiprocessor Shared-Memory Information Exchange (MSMIE) (Savi Maharaj): 
The Multiprocessor Shared-Memory Information Exchange (MSMIE) is a protocol for "inter-processor communications in distributed, microprocessor-based nuclear safety systems" which has been used in the embedded software of Westinghouse nucear systems designs. This small note contains three level of abstract descriptions expressed using VDM-SL (and one alternative modelling strategy). More information about the protocol can be found in "Multiprocessor Shared-Memory Information Exchange" by L.L. Santoline et al. This was published in IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 16(1), 1989. More information about the VDM model (and a corresponding PVS model) and the analysis of it can be found in "Proof in VDM: Case Studies" edited by J.C. Bicarregui. This is published by Springer in the FACIT series with ISBN 3540761861.
