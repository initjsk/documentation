Modelling Medical Information Systems (Richard Bradford and John Fitzgerald) : 
The Common Basic Specification (CBS) Generic Model is a structured model of activities undertaken by the UK National Health Service. The model is mediated by a mixture of entity-relationship models and informal text. The work described here involves the development of a prototype formal model for part of the CBS. It shows how the constructs in the entity-relationship models might be represented in a VDM-SL specification and raises some of the semantic questions which result from the model's informality. The prototype model was developed and tested using the IFAD VDM-SL Toolbox. A source file will be available shortly.
