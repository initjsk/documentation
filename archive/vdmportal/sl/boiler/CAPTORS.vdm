\subsection{The captors}\label{CAPTORS}

The next module introduces the captors as a series of state variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item $qc$ reports on the water level;
\item $sc$ reports on the steam outcome;
\item $p-mode$ and $p-flow$ report on the state of the pumps. 
%An invariant
%constrains these captors and states that the flow is null when the pump is
%$Off$.
%\footnote{
%This state invariant does only make sense in this model where  failures are
%not considered.}
\end{itemize}
