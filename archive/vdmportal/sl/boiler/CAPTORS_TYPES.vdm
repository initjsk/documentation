\section{Introducing captors}

Captors allow the controller to  get information about the state of the boiler.
A first model  of the captors will not take into account the possibility of
failures.


\subsection{Types for the captors}\label{CAPTORS_TYPES}

Most types have already been introduced for the captors. In this module, 
some special types are introduced for pumps, because the captors do not report
directly on the state of the pump.

\begin{vdm_al}
module CAPTORS_TYPES
imports from BOILER_TYPES all
exports all

definitions

types 
\end{vdm_al}
As far as pumps are concerned, the captors provide two kinds of information: is
the pump on/off, is there a flow of water through the pump?

\begin{vdm_al}
pump_mode = <On> | <Off> ;

pump_flow = <Flow> | <Outflow> ;
\end{vdm_al}
Two maps from pumps to these two types are introduced. The maps are total for
the pump numbers.

\begin{vdm_al}
pump_to_mode_map = map BOILER_TYPES`pump_nb to pump_mode 
inv pm == dom pm = BOILER_TYPES`Pump_nb_set ;
pump_to_flow_map = map BOILER_TYPES`pump_nb to pump_flow
inv pm == dom pm = BOILER_TYPES`Pump_nb_set
end CAPTORS_TYPES

\end{vdm_al}
