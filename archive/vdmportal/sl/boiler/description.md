A VDM Specification of the Steam-Boiler Problem (Yves Ledru and Marie-Laure Potet): 
This is a VDM-SL solution to the ``Steam Boiler Control Specification Problem''. The seminar "Methods for Semantics and Specification" was held at Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany, on June 5-9, 1995. The seminar took the form of a "competition" between different researchers who had been invited as representatives of their particular methods. This specification is split into a number of modules which are placed in different files. Note that this example uses older features of module structuring in VDM-SL no longer supported by VDMTools.
