\section{Introducing Actuators}

Next, the actuators are introduced in the model. Actuators correspond to the
available means for the controller to act on the boiler. In this case study,
these are the pumps, the valve, and the ability to switch to emergency stop
mode. 

\subsection{Types for the actuators}\label{ACTUATORS_TYPES}

To speak about actuators, types must be introduced for the actions on the
actuators:

\begin{itemize}
\item Three actions can be performed on the pumps: to switch it on or off, and
to do nothing. 
\item Similar actions can be performed on the valve.
\item Finally, the emergency stop actions are: to activate the emergency stop
or do nothing.
\end{itemize}

For each of the actuators, it was decided to introduce a ``do nothing''
action. This was motivated by the fact that the choice to do nothing is a
decision of the controller. 
A $pump-to-action-map$ type is also introduced to assign an action to each pump.
