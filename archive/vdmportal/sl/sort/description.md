A small Sorting Example (Peter Gorm Larsen): 
This small example is used for demonstration purposes in the Users manual to the IFAD VDM-SL Toolbox. This small specification contains a number of different VDM-SL specification for sorting of numeric values. Both implicit and explicit examples are given. It is also illustrated how one can combine code generated by the VDM-SL to C++ code generator with hand coded C++ code.
